Do you like Steam? Of course you do! Join UCC's Steam Group: \url{http://steamcommunity.com/groups/UCC}

\noindent UCC runs its own TF2, WolfET and Minecraft servers. They generally work but occasionally do not.
There's also a range of other games that members enjoy playing in the clubroom.

\section{Minecraft}
Minecraft is a game where you mine blocks and craft things out of them. It is more exciting than it sounds - within 5 minutes you will be addicted.
Our (modded) Minecraft server is at \shell{minecraft.ucc.asn.au}. The modpack changes every three to six months, so you will never get bored!

For more instructions, visit \url{http://minecraft.ucc.asn.au/ucc}.

\section{WolfET}
Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, (or just ET) is an old game but is still incredibly popular at LANs. One of the scholarships  available for the camp requires playing ET.

The ET server is at \server{heathred.ucc.asn.au}.

\section{Team Fortress 2}
Team Fortress 2, also known as Hat Simulator 2 is a game where the aim is to collect all the hats.

The TF2 server is located at \shell{heathred.ucc.asn.au}.

\section{DotA}
DotA is a game that involves a lot of clicking and people yelling about 'Q's and 'W's and 'alties'. Apparently it's fun. UCC doesn't run its own server but it is the most popular game in the clubroom. Unless that's LoL. I can't tell the difference. If you want to have a game with people, it is best to ask around, because there are always people looking to play.

\section{LoL}
LoL is a game similar to DoTa but not the same because it is different.
