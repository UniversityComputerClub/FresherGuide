%A large number of the UCC's computers run UNIX or Linux. If you've never encountered UNIX before, it might be a bit daunting for you. While most UNIX operating systems come with nice graphical desktops, the power is all in the text-based shell. Here are some common shell commands, in no particular order. There will be a "Learn to Linux" night at some point to help you out with some of the finer points.

%Many commands have an available help summary that you can get by appending \verb/--help/.
