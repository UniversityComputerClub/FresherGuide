\begin{welcome}{President}{Mitchell Pomery}{mjpomery}

\noindent Welcome to UCC and our Survival Guide!

\textbf{TL;DR;} We have computers, play games, toy with technology and are self proclaimed cool people to be around.

We are a combination of students interested in computers and people in the workplace who have failed to escape the clubs grasp.
Our club is a no knowledge needed place where you can come to meet friends, work on your own projects or play games and socialise.
The events we run range in skill level to make sure everyone is catered for.
You can find out exactly what events we are running this year later in this guide.

If you want to get the most out of UCC, come visit us in our clubroom. It is open pretty much all the time.
If you want to keep up to date with what is happening at UCC, you can join our mailing lists or our facebook group.

\noindent Mitchell Pomery [BG3] \\
UCC President 2014
