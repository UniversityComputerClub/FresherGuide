\noindent Welcome to the UCC and our Survival Guide!

UCC is a combination of students interested in computers and people in the workplace who have failed to escape our grasp.
Our club is a no knowledge needed place where you can come to meet friends, work on your projects or play games.
You don't need any technical knowledge to enjoy what our club has to offer and the evets we run range in skill level to make sure everyone is catered for.
If you want to learn how to program we have an intro to programming tutorial and if you already know how to, we have frequent hacking nights were you can work on your projects, or maybe help someone with theirs.
We also run a heap of social events such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item LANs
	\item our Annual Camp during July
	\item our 41st Anniversary Dinner in September
	\item the Charity Vigil
	\item Tech Talks
\end{itemize}

If you want to get the most out of UCC, come visit us in our clubroom. It is open pretty much all the time.
If you want to keep up to date with whats happening at UCC, you can join our mailing lists or our facebook group.

Mitchell Pomery [BG3]
UCC President 2014
