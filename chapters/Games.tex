\noindent UCC runs its own TF2, WolfET and Minecraft servers.
There are also a range of other games that members enjoy playing in the clubroom. Here is a summary.

\section{Minecraft}

Minecraft is a game where you mine blocks and craft things out of them. It is more exciting than it sounds. Within 5 minutes you will be addicted. But you probably already know this. 
Our (modded) Minecraft server is at \shell{minecraft.ucc.asn.au}. The modpack changes every three to six months, so you will never get bored!

For more instructions, visit \url{http://minecraft.ucc.asn.au/ucc}. You can also find maps of the world there. %\figref{minecraft_pigmap.png}.

\section{WolfET}

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, (or just ET) is an old game but is still incredibly popular at LANs. There is a scholarship \seeref{camp_scholarship} available for the camp which requires playing ET. The ET server is at \server{heathred.ucc.asn.au}.

\section{TF2}

Team Fortress 2, also known as Hat Fortress 2. The TF2 server is located at \shell{heathred.ucc.asn.au}.

\section{DoTa}

DoTa is a game that involves a lot of clicking and people yelling about 'Q's and 'W's and 'alties'. Apparently it's fun. UCC doesn't run its own server but it is the most popular game in the clubroom. Unless that's LoL. I can't tell the difference.

\section{LoL}

LoL is a game similar to DoTa but not the same because it is different.
