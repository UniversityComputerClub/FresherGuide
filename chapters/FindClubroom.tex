% Directions to the clubroom, ideally with non terrible maps. Most people don't ever find it :-(

\section{Directions}

\begin{mdframed}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Starting from the carpark outside The Tav, follow the arrow on the aerial picture to get to the Cameron Hall door, then go up the stairs to the second floor and follow the bottom map.
	\item If you see a coke machine and a snack machine, you are in the right place. The UCC clubroom has lots of computers and a couple of couches.
	\item If you accidentally find yourself surrounded by books and a fridge, you're in UniSFA --- try the other door in that corridor.
\end{enumerate}

You can see if the clubroom is open online at \url{http://webcams.ucc.asn.au/}
