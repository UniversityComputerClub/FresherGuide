\%TODO: Remember to write welcome before printing

\end{welcome}

\begin{welcome}{Vice President}{Sam Moore}{matches}

Since the President hasn't written anything, it is my duty as Vice President to pick up the slack and welcome you to the 2014 Fresher Guide.

Welcome to the 2014 Fresher Guide!

Still here?

In that case, my advice to freshers is to \pun{stay fresh}.

\end{welcome}
