\chapter{Setting Up Your Account}

% How to actually make an account. Most Freshers never do this :-(

Your UCC account is one of the most important things you can have as a member. It lets you log into any of our clubroom machines, as well as granting you access to our user servers, wireless network and online drink and snack machines.


You'll need to come into the clubroom to set up your account. Once you're here, ask around for a Wheel or Committee member and have your membership sticker (we normally put it on your student card on O-Day) to set up your account. You'll need a user name and a password to memorise, but it's a pretty simple procedure once you've found the right person!


Now that you have an account, you can use it to log into any of our clubroom machines. If you want to log onto one of our servers, you'll need to use the SSH program. If you're having trouble, just ask someone in the clubroom --- we don't \pun{byte}!


Changing your UCC password can either be done by Ctrl-Alt-Del on a windows machine or using the command \shell{passwd} on a Linux/Unix machine.
Accessing the UCC WiFi network can be a bit tricky (particularly on Windows machines). Ask someone if you need help, or refer to \url{http://wiki.ucc.asn.au/Wifi}
