The clubroom is usually open from about 9am until 11pm (staying later than this requires \emph{a good reason} and giving notice to UWA security). It is also sometimes open on weekends, and most days during university holidays. There is a map to the clubroom in Chapter \ref{FindClubroom}. If you want to check the clubroom is open and who is there, check out \url{http://webcam.ucc.asn.au}

The clubroom has a heap of desktop computers, a server room, a projects area with tool cupboard, and assorted storage areas for parts, books and components. These things are all there for members to use --- the locks on everything are to keep thieves out, so please don't be put off, and just ask if you need to get into something.

We don't have cleaners, so look after the clubroom! There is always a door group member in the room, \rant{and you will do what they damn well tell you to do as they are the ones who have to come to cleanups in their free time.} Of course, if you see something that needs doing such as cleaning up, feel free to do it!
