% How to use Dispense.

At the same time as you set up your account, you will also have your dispense account set up. Dispense is the program that allows users to store credit and purchase items from the coke/snack machines (which are almost always cheaper than what you would find elsewhere on campus).


This will involve a 5 digit User ID and a 4 digit PIN. This allows you to physically log into the snack machine and dispense both drinks and snacks.
Coke members can help you add credit to your dispense account. Call out for one in the clubroom if need be, there's always one around.


You can also use your Student Card/SmartRider as a log in device on the snack machine. To do so, log in to the Snack Machine and hold whichever card you want to use up to the card scanner (it's the thing with the blinking green light) and the card should auto- enroll. To log in using the card, simply hold the enrolled card up to the card scanner.


You can also access Dispense online via shell login and using the \shell{dispense} command. Dispense isn't installed on clubroom machines so you will have to use \shell{ssh} to access one of UCC's servers. You can get someone to show you how to do this, or alternatively, go to: \url{http://wiki.ucc.asn.au/SSH}
